        <p>Living a long and healthy life doesn’t require extreme measures. Small, consistent habits can significantly
            improve your well-being and increase your lifespan. Here are five simple yet powerful habits you can adopt
            today.</p>

        <h2>1. Maintain a Balanced Diet</h2>
        <p>Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins provides your body with essential
            nutrients. Reducing processed foods and sugars can also help prevent chronic diseases.</p>

        <h2>2. Stay Physically Active</h2>
        <p>Regular exercise, whether it's walking, cycling, or strength training, keeps your body strong and your heart
            healthy. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity per day.</p>

        <h2>3. Get Enough Sleep</h2>
        <p>Sleep is crucial for overall health. Aiming for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night supports brain
            function, reduces stress, and helps prevent health issues.</p>

        <h2>4. Manage Stress Effectively</h2>
        <p>Chronic stress can negatively impact your body and mind. Practicing mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation
            techniques can improve your overall well-being.</p>

        <h2>5. Stay Connected with Loved Ones</h2>
        <p>Strong social connections contribute to mental and emotional well-being. Spend time with family and friends,
            and don’t hesitate to seek support when needed.</p>

        <p>By incorporating these habits into your daily routine, you can improve your quality of life and enjoy better
            health for years to come.</p>
